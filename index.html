<h1>Virtual Reality in Education</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
From an early age, we are often told that learning goes beyond the classroom, and this idea remains true. Education is not limited to the content taught in lectures, but is also shaped by how knowledge is applied, practiced, and reflected on outside the traditional classroom setting. While the founders of education have held us to this standard, it is time we move beyond the classroom and understand how Virtual Reality (VR) can transform learning as we know it.
</p>

<p>
VR is defined by the University of Baltimore as "a computer-generated, immersive, and interactive experience that simulates a three-dimensional environment, often with the aid of specialized hardware such as headsets and controllers." (UMB Faculty Center for Teaching and Learning, n.d.). In short, VR is an emerging educational technology that allows students to engage with immersive simulations and lectures.
</p>

<p>
Incorporating VR can make a significant impact in the education industry, especially alongside other learning styles, for example, visual learners who might benefit from moving away from traditional classroom settings that rely heavily on lectures and textbooks. Additionally, VR provides the excitement that many students crave in academia and can raise student engagement.
</p>

<p>
The push for VR is not just about changing the teaching format in schools, but about renewing students’ love for learning. VR should be implemented into schools because it enables students to reinforce their textbook learning, which allows them to better understand the concepts they are introduced to. Learning should not be limited to the classroom; VR gives students the chance to explore beyond their perceived obstacles. It is more than a new teaching fad—it is a concept that has already been implemented in nursing schools to ensure that a graduating nurse’s first physical patient is not their first patient. Additionally, virtual reality offers exploration at a new level; students can now visit museums, landmarks, and many more environments through VR.

<h2>VR for Medical & Nursing Training</h2>

<p>
Osso VR is a top virtual reality surgical training platform used by medical schools and hospitals including Harvard Medical School, UCSF, and the Mayo Clinic. It allows students and doctors to perform surgical operations in a realistic 3D environment with a VR headset and controls.
</p>

<p><strong>Context & How It Is Used:</strong></p>
<p>
VR is used to provide medical and nursing students with hands-on, risk-free experience. Students enter a virtual operating room, follow step-by-step instructions, carry out surgical procedures, and receive immediate feedback. They can practice treatments as many times as they want, honing their skills and confidence before treating patients.
</p>

<p><strong>Social Challenge – Cost and Access:</strong></p>
<p>
VR equipment is expensive, resulting in disparities between high- and low-budget programs.
</p>

<p><strong>Skill Transfer:</strong></p>
<p>
Virtual reality cannot totally substitute real-world patient experience or human mentoring. Technical issues include motion sickness, limited realism, and the necessity for IT support.
</p>

<p><strong>Data Concerns:</strong></p>
<p>
Student performance data may pose privacy and evaluation issues.
</p>

<p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong></p>
<p>
VR training enhances patient safety, boosts student confidence, and standardizes medical education. However, it presents concerns about equity, realism, and privacy, all of which must be addressed before fair and effective adoption can occur.

<h2>Application Case Study #2 – VR Field Trips</h2>

<h3>Real-World Example: Google Arts & Culture VR</h3>

<p>
Google Expeditions was one of the most widely used VR classroom tools before being integrated into Google Arts & Culture, which now provides VR-based virtual field trips used in K–12 classrooms around the world. The platform allows students to explore historical sites, museums, and cultural landmarks in immersive 360° environments.
</p>

<h3>Context and Purpose</h3>

<p>
Google Arts & Culture VR is used to bring real-world locations into the classroom, especially for subjects like history, geography, and world cultures. Instead of learning from a textbook alone, students can virtually walk through ancient ruins, explore the Great Wall of China, or experience life inside historic civilizations. Teachers guide the experience by selecting destinations, highlighting points of interest, and using prompts to support class discussion.
</p>

<p>
The purpose of these VR field trips is to deepen student engagement, make distant concepts more tangible, and support different learning styles — especially visual and experiential learners who benefit from interactive environments.
</p>

<h3>Ethical and Social Concerns</h3>

<p>
One major concern with VR field trips is inequitable access. Many schools cannot afford VR headsets or lack the required internet speeds, which creates a divide where wealthier districts benefit from immersive learning while underfunded schools fall behind.
</p>

<p>
Another issue is accuracy and cultural representation. If VR designers portray historical events or locations in a simplified or biased way, students may form misunderstandings about important cultural or historical topics.
</p>

<p>
Teacher readiness also presents challenges. Without proper training, educators may struggle to integrate VR into lesson plans, reducing effectiveness and causing confusion. VR platforms may also collect student interaction or performance data, raising privacy concerns that schools must manage carefully to protect minors.

<h2>Ethical Analysis</h2>

<h3>Utilitarianism</h3>

<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Actions are ethically right if they bring benefit for the greatest number of people.</p>

<ul>
  <li>VR can increase student engagement across cognitive, behavioral, and affective dimensions.</li>
  <li>Cognitive engagement: Helps students understand complex content through 3D environments.</li>
  <li>Behavioral engagement: Encourages participation, attendance, and completion of assignments.</li>
  <li>Affective engagement: Increases motivation, interest, and empathy.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Potential harms:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Lack of teacher training and technical support.</li>
  <li>Poor implementation may waste resources and reduce learning benefits.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Justice / Fairness</h3>

<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Create systems that treat everyone fairly and distribute benefits equally.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Supports adaptive learning for students with disabilities.</li>
  <li>Helps students who struggle with traditional classrooms.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Unequal access risks widening educational inequality.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Recommendations</h2>

<h3>Schools and Educators</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Provide teacher training and technical support.</li>
  <li>Use pilot programs before full implementation.</li>
  <li>Use VR as a supplement, not a replacement.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Policymakers</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fund under-resourced schools.</li>
  <li>Develop VR usage standards.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Technology Companies</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Create affordable, user-friendly VR tools.</li>
  <li>Support curriculum integration.</li>
</ul>
